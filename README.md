# About
`LogParser` is a command line tool which can be used to parse logs generated by Android's logcat service during the execution of the `IntentFuzzer` tool. All generated logs have to be formatted in logcat's standart output format for this tool to work properly. The tool searches the log entries stored in the files for stacktraces. Based on the found data it generates output files containing the stacktraces ordered by the component in which they were raised as well as if they caused an application crash or not.

# Build
